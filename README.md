# Machine_Learning_Classes

Project contain classes for learning ML models or to prepare and visualize data. Classes in the repository creates ML models using grid search for optimizing parameters, creates the best model on given test data, and train them of given datasets. Then classes have methods to compare models performence.

In the current version there are classes for:

1. Regression,
Contains models from sklearn
Only using mae and mse for testing performace which will be changed in futere versions

2. Classification
Covers sklearn models
Only using accuracy which in the future versions will be added precision, recall and f1 score


Projects still evolving and number of existing models in classes can be bigger, for more info check existing class files.
Versions and names of functions changing.

Future plans:
- NLP class for processing text that contains:
  - building baseline,
  - remove emoiji and filter input data, BeautifulSoup
  - tokenize and embedding
  - building simple models and ability to make them complex

- ModelData:
  - add functionality of package seaborn for visualize data
  - key features extractions,
  - more complex data visualization
  
Far future:
  - timeseries,
  - vision
